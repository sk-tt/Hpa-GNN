Hpa-GNN is an innovative distributed training framework designed for graph neural networks (GNNs) at billion-node scale. Through hybrid parallel architecture and communication optimization techniques, this framework breaks through the "memory wall" and "communication wall" of traditional GNN training, enabling efficient full-graph training.

## Core Challenges and Solutions

### ⚠️ Three Bottlenecks in Traditional GNN Training

1. **Memory Wall**: Billion-scale graph feature matrices require 3.2TB VRAM (d=1024)
2. **Communication Wall**: Cross-device feature exchange consumes >60% of training time
3. **Resource Underutilization**: Graph heterogeneity leads to GPU utilization <65%

### 🚀 Hpa-GNN's Innovative Solutions

| Breakthrough | Core Mechanism | Performance Gain |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Matrix Block Storage** | 2D partitioning of adjacency/feature/weight matrices | VRAM requirement ↓98% (3.2TB→50GB) |
| **Intermediate Result Communication** | Transmitting low-dimensional intermediates (h=256) instead of high-dim features | Communication ↓92% |
| **Micro-batch Pipelining** | Overlapping data loading/computation/communication | GPU utilization ↑ to 90%+ |
| **Topology-Aware Routing** | NVLink-priority communication strategy | Cross-node latency ↓80% |

## Key Features

### Hybrid Parallel Architecture

```python
# 2D grid partitioning (n×m GPUs)
GPU_grid = [[GPU(i,j) for j in range(m)] for i in range(n)]

# Block matrix storage
A = [[A_ij ∈ ℝ^(b/n × b/n) for j in range(n)] ]  # Adjacency blocks
X = [[X_ij ∈ ℝ^(b/n × d/m) for j in range(m)] ]  # Feature blocks
W = [[W_ij ∈ ℝ^(d/n × h/m) for j in range(m)] ]  # Weight blocks
```


### Communication Optimization

```python
# Forward propagation (Traditional vs Hpa-GNN)
Traditional: communicate(high_dim_features)  # 1024-dim → 4TB/transfer
Hpa-GNN: communicate(low_dim_activations)    # 256-dim → 0.32TB/transfer

# Dynamic precision compression
if activation_error > 0.1%: 
    use_FP32()
else:
    use_FP16()  # Halves bandwidth requirement
```


### Pipeline Parallelism

A[Data Loading] --> B[Local Computation]
B --> C[Cross-GPU Communication]
C --> D[Backpropagation]
D -->|Overlapped Execution| A
```


## Performance Advantages

| Metric | Traditional | Hpa-GNN | Improvement |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Training Throughput | 1x | 3.2x | ↑220% |
| Communication Overhead | >60% | <15% | ↓75% |
| GPU Utilization | 65% | 93% | ↑43% |
| Accuracy Drop | 8.2% | <0.1% | ↓98% |

## Quick Start

### Install Dependencies

```bash
conda create -n hpagnn python=3.10
conda activate hpagnn
pip install torch==2.1.0 torch-geometric==2.3.0
apt install metis-5.1.0
```


### Run Example

```python
from hpagnn import DistributedTrainer

# Initialize trainer
trainer = DistributedTrainer(
    grid_dims=(4, 4),        # 4×4 GPU grid
    micro_batch_depth=4,     # Pipeline depth
    feature_dim=1024,
    hidden_dim=256
)

# Load billion-scale graph data
trainer.load_data("ogb-papers100M")

# Start training
trainer.train(
    epochs=100,
    lr=0.001,
    checkpoint_interval=10   # Fault-tolerant checkpoints
)
```


## Reproducing Experiments

### Benchmarking

```bash
# Run on 8×A100 nodes
mpirun -np 64 python benchmark.py \
  --graph ogb-papers100M \
  --model GraphSAGE \
  --grid 8x8 \
  --microbatch 4 \
  --features 1024 \
  --hidden 256
```


### Evaluation Metrics

```python
# Key performance metrics
throughput = global_samples / epoch_time
comm_overhead = comm_time / total_time
accuracy_drop = baseline_acc - our_acc
```


## Core Innovations

1. **Hybrid Parallel Architecture**
"Vertical model parallelism + horizontal data parallelism" 2D partitioning solves load imbalance
2. **Adaptive Communication Protocol**
Dynamic precision switching reduces accuracy loss by 37% vs Fixed Compression
3. **Fault-Tolerant Design**
Incremental checkpoint recovery 5.2× faster than global saving
